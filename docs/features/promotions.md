# Promotions

Currently you can apply a percentage or flat amount promotion for each product individually, if their content type has the _Discount_ content part.

1. Enable the _Orchard Core Commerce - Promotion_ feature.
2. Edit the product in the content item editor.
3. Set either the _Discount Percentage_ or _Discount Amount_ fields. You can't set both.
4. You may set the _Beginning Utc_ and _Expiration Utc_ fields for a timed discount period.
5. Set the _Maximum Products_ field if you want to limit how many products can be bought discounted in one order.
6. Set the _Minimum Products_ field if you only want to discount bulk orders.
