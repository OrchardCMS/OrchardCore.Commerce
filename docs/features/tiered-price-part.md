# TieredPricePart

Allows setting several prices for a product based on the quantity purchased at once.

## Fields and properties
- **DefaultPrice** (`Amount`): Sets the base price of the product, which will be applicable until the selected quantity reaches one of the specified tiers.
- **PriceTiers** (`IList<PriceTier>`): A list of [`PriceTiers`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/blob/main/src/Modules/OrchardCore.Commerce/Models/PriceTier.cs) that determine which price to use at which quantity. The currency of these prices follows the currency set for the _DefaultPrice_ property. If there are no tiers specified, the _DefaultPrice_'s value is used in all cases.

## Usage examples
The price tiers can be set in the product's editor.
