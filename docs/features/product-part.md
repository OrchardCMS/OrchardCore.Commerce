# ProductPart

A content item becomes a product if it has a `ProductPart` and a price providing part (e.g. [`PricePart`](price-part.md), [`PriceVariantsPart`](price-variants-part.md), or [`TieredPricePartPart`](tiered-price-part.md)).

## Fields and properties
- **SKU** (`string`): The product's stock keeping unit, used for identification purposes. Must be globally unique and cannot contain the hyphen (`-`) character.
- **CanBeBought** (`IDictionary<string, bool>`): Determines whether the product can currently be bought based on current inventory settings. If there is no [`InventoryPart`](inventory-part.md) on the product, it is unused. This is not editable in the product's editor.
- **ProductImage** (`MediaField`): Allows selecting an image from the Media Library that will be displayed on the product's page.

## Usage examples
The _SKU_ and the _Product Image_ properties can be set in the product's editor.
