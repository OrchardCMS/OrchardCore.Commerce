# PriceVariantsPart

Provides multiple prices to a product based on predefined attributes. This currently only supports [`TextProductAttributeField`](text-product-attribute-field.md)s that are restricted to predefined values.

If [`InventoryPart`](inventory-part.md) is present, there will be multiple separate inventories for the variants.

In case of multiple attribute fields on a content type, a price field will be created for each possible combination. Individual inventories can be created using a recipe, see the sample [Price Variant Product](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/blob/main/src/Modules/OrchardCore.Commerce/Recipes/OrchardCore.Commerce.Samples.Product.recipe.json#L145).

Adding or editing product attributes can be done in the content type's editor (see below).

## Fields and properties
- **Variants** (`IDictionary<string, Amount>`): This property stores each variant's SKU along with their price.

## Usage examples
New attribute fields can be added or existing fields can be edited in the content type's editor.

With _InventoryPart_ present, the inventory of each variant can be set in the content item's editor.

On the product's page, a variant can be selected and added to the cart. If inventories exist, they are also displayed here.
