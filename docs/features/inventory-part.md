# InventoryPart

The `InventoryPart` adds basic inventory management capabilities to a product. Requires [`ProductPart`](product-part.md) to be present on the content type as well.

## Fields and properties

- **AllowsBackOrder** (`BooleanField`): When set to true, product can be ordered even when the Inventory field's value is below 1.
- **IgnoreInventory** (`BooleanField`): When set to true, all inventory checks (within [`InventoryShoppingCartEvents`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/blob/main/src/Modules/OrchardCore.Commerce/Events/InventoryShoppingCartEvents.cs)) are bypassed.
- **Inventory** (`IDictionary<string, int>`): Sets the number of available products. Uses a `Dictionary<string, int>` object to keep track of multiple inventories (which is mostly relevant for products with a [`PriceVariantsPart`](price-variants-part.md) attached to them).
- **MaximumOrderQuantity** (`NumericField`): Determines the maximum amount of products that can be placed in an order. Also sets the upper limit for the _Quantity_ input on the product's page. This field is ignored if its value is set to 0 or below.
- **MinimumOrderQuantity** (`NumericField`): Determines the minimum amount of products that can be placed in an order. Also sets the lower limit for the _Quantity_ input on the product's page. This field is ignored if its value is set to 0 or below.
- **OutOfStockMessage** (`HtmlField`): Enables providing a specific message for an out of stock product. Defaults to "Out of Stock".

By default, the below fields' shapes are empty, so they do not show up on the user-facing part of the site:

- _AllowsBackOrder_
- _IgnoreInventory_
- _MaximumOrderQuantity_
- _MinimumOrderQuantity_

## Usage examples

All the inventory-related settings can be found in the product's editor.

With a product's inventory set to a valid value, the current inventory count will appear on the product's page.

With a maximum order quantity specified, trying to add more products to the cart than allowed will result in a validation error.

With a minimum order quantity specified, trying to add fewer products to the cart than allowed will result in a validation error.

With a custom out of stock message provided, the message will show up on the product's page when its inventory is below 1 and back ordering is not allowed.
