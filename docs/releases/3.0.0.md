# Orchard Core Commerce 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Important Upgrade Instructions

Prior to making the leap to Orchard Core Commerce 3.0.0, please read and follow the instructions for the [Orchard Core 2.0.0 release](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/releases/2.0.0/), as it contains several major breaking changes.

## Breaking Changes

### Drop `Newtonsoft.Json` Support

The most important breaking change in OC 2.0 is the end of support for [Newtonsoft Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) and the switch to the [System.Text.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json) (STJ) library. For OCC, this means the break

### Replace `IPayment` with `Payment` everywhere

We've dropped the [`IPayment`](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/blob/34ae00470e954459f19f688c9bfc51d196c386ca/src/Libraries/OrchardCore.Commerce.Abstractions/Abstractions/IPayment.cs) interface, now services and models use `Payment` directly, which was also moved into the `OrchardCore.Commerce.Abstractions` library. Migrating to STJ meant that to retain the polymorphic deserialization support for models using `IPayment` would've taken on some additional complexity, while we already found the separate interface unnecessary.
If you have a custom payment processor integration, you will have to update it to use `Payment`.
