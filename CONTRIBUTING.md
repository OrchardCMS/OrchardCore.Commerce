# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?

Start a discussion on the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/issues).

## Reporting security issues

Security issues should be reported privately, via email, to <contact@orchardcore.net>.

## Other discussions

Our team members also monitor other discussion forums:

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/discussions).

## Contributing code and content

We accept fixes and features! Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.

- Look at the [documentation](/docs/).
- ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.
- ["Good first issue" issues](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Commerce/labels/good%20first%20issue) - we think these are a good for newcomers.

### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix. If you are submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the roadmap. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. All code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

### Submitting a pull request

You will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/) when submitting your pull request. To complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), you will need to follow the instructions provided by the CLA bot when you send the pull request. This needs to only be done once for any .NET Foundation OSS project.

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>. Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. The coding, style, and general engineering guidelines are published on the [ASP.Net Core Engineering guidelines](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/wiki/Engineering-guidelines) page, and see the [Lombiq .NET Analyzers](https://github.com/Lombiq/.NET-Analyzers) for information on the static code analysis tools used to enforce code style.

### Feedback

Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the subject matter experts on our team. Please be patient; we have hundreds of pull requests across all of our repositories. Update your pull request according to feedback until it is approved by one of the ASP.NET team members. After that, one of our team members may adjust the branch you merge into based on the expected release schedule.
